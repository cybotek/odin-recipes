        <ul>
            <li><h4>Step 1</h4>In a medium saucepan. Add, cream of tartar, salt, sugar, ginger, lemon juice and cinnamon stick. Bring water to a boil and let it simmer for about 10 minutes, Stirring syrup occasionally. Let it cool and refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
            <li><h4>Step 2</h4>In a large bowl combine all the dry ingredients- corn meal, flour, sugar, baking powder
                • Then all the wet ingredients milk and egg followed by butter. Knead several times until all the ingredients have been incorporated. Let it rest for about 30 minutes.
                • Place dough on board and roll out into about 1 inch thickness. Using a cookie cutter or knife cut into strips thin strips and then shorter strips.
                • Divide the dough into three strands and stretch them out carefully until they are of an even thickness all the way down. Pinch the ends together
                • Take the left strand and cross it over the middle strand.Take the right strand and cross it over the middle strand. Tightly pinch to seal the end.
            </li>
            <li><h4>Step 3</h4>In a large, sauce pan pour vegetable oil into a pot, until it is at least 3 inches Test to make sure the oil is hot enough by putting a ‘drop’ of batter into the oil. If it is not hot enough, the batter will stay at the bottom of the pot rather than rising to the top. If using a deep fryer, fry at 350 degrees
                Gently place koeksisters in the pan
                Fry for a few minutes until the bottom side is golden brown.
                Turn the over and fry for a few more minutes until the other side is golden brown.</li>
            <li><h4>Final Step</h4>Use a large spoon or something like that to take it out of the oil and directly place in syrup.
                Leave to soak in the syrup for a while. Transfer to a cooling rack. Cool completely before eating.</li>
